# SimpleWhisper

A user-friendly transcription tool using the [faster-whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) library, optimizing [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) models performance for CPU and GPU transcribing.

SimpleWhisper was developed as part of the [LaCAS Project](https://lacas.inalco.fr/le-projet-lacas) for [INALCO](https://www.inalco.fr/) (Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales).


## Method and Results

### Method

The faster-whisper library, developed by SYSTRAN, offers an optimized and efficient automatic speech recognition (ASR) system. Despite its powerful capabilities, Whisper requires command-line interactions and technical setup, which can be a barrier for many users. SimpleWhisper addresses this by providing a graphical user interface (GUI) that abstracts the complexity of the Whisper model, allowing users to easily transcribe audio or video files.

**Key features:**
- **Model Loading:** Load different sizes of Whisper models based on user requirements.
- **Audio Conversion:** Convert video files to audio format using `ffmpeg`.
- **Transcription:** Transcribe audio files with or without timecodes.
- **GPU Acceleration:** Utilize CUDA for GPU acceleration to speed up transcription (if available).


## Running Instructions

To run SimpleWhisper, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `ffmpeg` installed and available in the system path.
-  `tkinter` installed.
- For GPU acceleration (optional), ensure you have CUDA installed. Check [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) for installation instructions.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/SeidSmatti/SimpleWhisper.git
    cd SimpleWhisper
    ```

2. Create a virtual environment(optional):
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4. Install tkinter
   
   For Mac OS
   ```sh
   brew install python-tk
   ```

   For Linux (Debian based)
   ```
   sudo apt-get install python3-tk
   ```

   For Windows

   Usually comes pre-installed with Python, if not see the [official documentation](https://tkdocs.com/tutorial/install.html)
    


** NOTE : For Liux and Windows, you can directly download the (so far unsigned) binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/SeidSmatti/SimpleWhisper/releases).**
### Usage

1. Run the application:
    ```sh
    python src/main.py
    ```

2. Alternatively, install the package and use the entry point:
    ```sh
    pip install .
    simplewhisper
    ```

### Features

- Loading video or audio formats (with automatic conversion).
- Basic output formating choice.
- A choice between running the model on CPU or GPU.


### Running Tests

Run the unit tests to ensure everything is working correctly:
```sh
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

## About

SimpleWhisper was initially developed as part of the LaCAS Project for INALCO (Institut National des Langues et Civilisations Orientales). The project aims to make advanced transcription technology accessible to a broader audience. 

This project is part of the collaborative efforts within the LaCAS team to advance areal studies through innovative technological solutions.
